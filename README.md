## a bit about this endeavor
This is my Day 1 project for [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/PollinaKire-FS/100-days-of-code/blob/main/log.md). Iâ€™m wrapping up my first year back in development after a few years in healthcare, and Iâ€™m enjoying the process a lot more this time around. [Read more about my journey in my log](https://github.com/PollinaKire-FS/100-days-of-code/blob/main/log.md), or [follow along on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kirenia.bsky.social).
